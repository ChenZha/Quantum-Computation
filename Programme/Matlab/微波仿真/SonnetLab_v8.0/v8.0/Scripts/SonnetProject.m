            %   will save and simulate the project first. Current
            %   calculations will be enabled for the project.
            %
            %   There are two approaches to calling this method:
            %   The first approach is the pass the method a
            %   Sonnet current data request configuration file.
            %
            %       Example: Project.exportCurrents(aRequestFile);

            %   The second approach to calling this method involves passing

            %   the method will essentially build an output configuration
            %   file. The arguments are the following:
            %
            %      1) Region - The region must be either a JXYLine object,
            %                  a JXYRectangle object or []. If the region
            %                  is [] then the currents for the entire layout
            %                  will be outputted.
            %      2) Type  -  The type must be either 'JX','JY','JXY' or
            %                  'PWR' (for heat flux)
            %      3) Ports -  The ports should be either a vector of JXYPort
            %                  objects or a matrix that stores the voltage and
            %                  phase values for each port. The user only has
            %                  to define values for ports that have non-zero
            %                  voltage or phase values. When using a matrix
            %                  the data must be formatted as follows:
            %                     [PortNumber, Voltage, Phase;
            %                      PortNumber, Voltage, Phase; ...]
            %      4) Frequency -  A vector specifying the desired frequency values.
            %                      Values should be specified in the same units as the project.
            %      5) (Optional) X Grid Size - This determines the X direction resolution
            %                                  of the exported data. The grid size is the
            %                                  separation between two data points. The first
            %                                  value in the series is half of the grid size.
            %                                  Ex: a value of two would provide data at the
            %                                  points 1,3,5,7... If the grid X size is
            %                                  unspecified then the cell size from the project
            %                                  will be utilized. If the X grid size is []
            %                                  then the the cell size from the project
            %                                  will be utilized.
            %      6) (Optional) Y Grid Size - This determines the Y direction resolution of
            %                                  the exported data. If the grid Y size
            %                                  is unspecified then the cell size from the
            %                                  project will be utilized. If the X grid size
            %                                  is [] then the the cell size from the project
            %                                  will be utilized.
            %      7) (Optional) Level -  Specifies what metallization  level(s)
            %                             should be outputted. The level should be [] if
            %                             all levels should be outputted. The level should
            %                             be a single number (Ex: 4) if only one level
            %                             should be outputted. If a range of levels
            %                             should be outputted then the level should be a
            %                             vector in the form of [startLevel, endLevel].
            %      8) (Optional) Complex - Should be either true or false. True indicates that
            %                              current data should be returned as complex numbers.
            %
            %   If the user would like to specify values for
            %   parameters they may use the last two arguments.
            %
            %      9)  ParameterName  -    Should be either a vertical vector of strings
            %                              (use strvcat) or a cell array of strings.
            %
            %      10) ParameterValue -    Should be either a vector or a cell array of values
            %                              such that the Nth element of ParameterValue is
            %                              the value for the parameter specified by the Nth
            %                              element of ParameterName.

            %           one with the latest install date.
            %   Note: This method will save the project to the hard drive. If
            %           there hasn't been a filename associated with this project
            %           an error will be thrown. A filename may be specified using
            %           the saveAs method (see "help SonnetProject.saveAs")
            %   Note: The X grid size and Y grid size values may be empty matricies ([]).
            %           This will cause the script to default to the project's cell size.
            %           This ability allows you to use default values for the grid size
            %           but still set non-default values for the metalization level and
            %           complex data fields.

            %ExportHeatFlux   Exports heat flux data
            %   Project.ExportHeatFlux(...) will call Sonnet and export
            %   the heat flux data for a region of a layout. This method
            %   will save and simulate the project first. Current
            %   calculations will be enabled for the project.
            %
            %   There are two approaches to calling this method:
            %   The first approach is the pass the method a
            %   Sonnet current data request configuration file.
            %
            %       Example: Project.ExportHeatFlux(aRequestFile);
            %
            %   The second approach to calling this method involves passing
            %   arguments that would specify the output settings such that
            %   the method will essentially build an output configuration
            %   file. The arguments are the following:
            %
            %      1) Region - The region must be either a JXYLine object,
            %                  a JXYRectangle object or []. If the region
            %                  is [] then the currents for the entire layout
            %                  will be outputted.
            %      2) Ports -  The ports should be either a vector of JXYPort
            %                  objects or a matrix that stores the voltage and
            %                  phase values for each port. The user only has
            %                  to define values for ports that have non-zero
            %                  voltage or phase values. When using a matrix
            %                  the data must be formatted as follows:
            %                     [PortNumber, Voltage, Phase;
            %                      PortNumber, Voltage, Phase; ...]
            %      3) Frequency -  A vector specifying the desired frequency values.
            %                      Values should be specified in the same units as the project.
            %      4) (Optional) X Grid Size - This determines the X direction resolution
            %                                  of the exported data. The grid size is the
            %                                  separation between two data points. The first
            %                                  value in the series is half of the grid size.
            %                                  Ex: a value of two would provide data at the
            %                                  points 1,3,5,7... If the grid X size is
            %                                  unspecified then the cell size from the project
            %                                  will be utilized.
            %      5) (Optional) Y Grid Size - This determines the Y direction resolution of
            %                                  the exported data. If the grid Y size
            %                                  is unspecified then the cell size from the
            %                                  project will be utilized.
            %      6) (Optional) Level -  Specifies what metallization  level(s)
            %                             should be outputted. The level should be [] if
            %                             all levels should be outputted. The level should
            %                             be a single number (Ex: 4) if only one level
            %                             should be outputted. If a range of levels
            %                             should be outputted then the level should be a
            %                             vector in the form of [startLevel, endLevel].
            %      7) (Optional) Complex - Should be either true or false. True indicates that
            %                              current data should be returned as complex numbers.
            %
            %   If the user would like to specify values for
            %   parameters they may use the last two arguments.
            %
            %      8)  ParameterName  -    Should be either a vertical vector of strings
            %                              (use strvcat) or a cell array of strings.
            %
            %      9)  ParameterValue -    Should be either a vector or a cell array of values
            %                              such that the Nth element of ParameterValue is
            %                              the value for the parameter specified by the Nth
            %                              element of ParameterName.

            %   Project.addOptimizationParameter(...) adds a new optimization
            %   parameter to the optimization block. Optimization
            %   parameters define how the optimization variables get modified.
            %
            %   addOptimizationParameter requires the following inputs:
            %       1)  A frequency sweep object. The frequency sweep
            %           cannot be SonnetFrequencyAbs or SonnetFrequencySimple.
            %           but SonnetFrequencyAbsEntry and SonnetFrequencySweep
            %           can be used instead and correspond to the same sweeps.
            %       2)  The response type (Ex: 'DB[S11]')
            %       3)  The relation type ('>', '<', '=')
            %       4)  The type for the target response ('VALUE','NET','FILE').
            %           This is what the response will be compared to.
            %       5)  The target value. For targets of type 'VALUE' this
            %           will store the response value we would like
            %           to obtain from optimization. For 'NET'
            %           this argument stores the name of the network
            %           to compare to. For type 'FILE' this stores
            %           the name of the file that should be used.
            %       6)  If the target type is 'FILE' or 'NET' then
            %           the response type for the target value is
            %           required. If the type is 'VALUE' then this
            %           should be the empty string ('');
            %       7)  The weight for this optimization parameter. This
            %           value is often 1.

            %   Project.defineNewViaMetalType(...) will add
            %   a via metal type to the project.
            %
            %   There are two ways to use defineNewViaMetalType. The user
            %   may define a metal type using a set of custom options or
            %   the user may define a type using a predefined property set
            %   from the Sonnet library.
            %
            %   If defineNewViaMetalType is to import a metal type from the
            %   Sonnet library then the following arguments must be specified
            %     1) The name of the metal
            %     2) The metal's thickness
            %
            %   If defineNewViaMetalType is to be used to define a custom
            %   metal type then the user must first specify the type of
            %   metal that is being defined and then specify the parameters
            %   for the metal type.
            %
            %   defineNewViaMetalType requires a type as
            %   the first argument which should
            %   be one of the following:
            %
            %       VOL   -   Volume Metal
            %       SFC   -   Surface Metal
            %       ARR   -   Array Metal
            %
            %   Then you will need to supply the necessary
            %   arguments for each type as follows:
            %
            %   VOL - Volume Metal
            %     1) The Name of the metal
            %     2) The Conductivity of the metal (inf for infinite)
            %     3) The Wall thickness (-1 or 'Solid' for solid)
            %
            %   SFC - Surface Metal
            %     1) The Name of the metal
            %     2) The Rdc value
            %     3) The Rrf value
            %     4) The Xdc value
            %
            %   ARR - Array Metal
            %     1) The Name of the metal

            %       % To accomplish our goal we can add a symmetric dimension parameter
            %       % to the project. The parameter will be named 'Width' and

            %       % reference vertex will be the first vertex of the desired
            %       % polygon and the second vertex value will be the second

            %       % the point sets may just be [4] and [3] because points 1 and 2 are
            %       % already going to be moved because they are the reference points.

            %       % the polygon. The polygon coordinate methods are intended for

            %       % can but the user should be aware that in that case they may
            %       % be better off specifying the coordinate manually). In order
            %       % to use methods such as lowerRightVertex() we will need to
            %       % obtain a reference to the desired polygon; this can be
